# Quick Setup

My personal setup script for Ubuntu.

## Disclaimer

I only made sure it worked on my Ubuntu-20 machine, you can still use it but keep in mind that you may encounter issues.

## Usage

Copy the following in your terminal:

```sh
export GIT_NAME=""     # your name
export GIT_EMAIL=""    # your email

curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benard-g/quick_setup/master/setup.sh | bash
chsh -s /usr/bin/fish
```
